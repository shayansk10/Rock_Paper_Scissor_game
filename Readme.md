# Rock Paper Scissors Game 🪨📄✂️

A simple yet engaging Python implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game against the computer. Features clean code, user-friendly input, and clear game outcomes.

## Features
- 🎮 **Classic Gameplay** - Traditional Rock Paper Scissors rules
- 🤖 **Computer Opponent** - Random choice generation
- ♻️ **Simple Input** - Single character input (r/p/s)
- 📊 **Clear Results** - Detailed outcome explanations
- 🎯 **Win/Lose/Draw** - Complete game logic handling
- 🔄 **Instant Feedback** - Immediate results after each round

## How to Play

### Input Options
- `r` for **Rock** 🪨
- `p` for **Paper** 📄  
- `s` for **Scissors** ✂️

### Game Rules
- Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)
- Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins)
- Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)
- Same choices result in Draw

## Installation & Usage

### Requirements
- Python 3.x installed

### Running the Game
python rock_paper_scissors.py

## Code Structure
### Key Components
- Random choice generation for computer moves
- Dictionary mapping for input conversion
- Comprehensive condition checking for all possible outcomes
- User-friendly output with clear messages

### Logic Implementation
<!-- Computer random choice
computer = random.choice([1, -1, 0])

User input mapping
youDict = {"r": 1, "p": -1, "s": 0}

Result determination through conditional checks -->
